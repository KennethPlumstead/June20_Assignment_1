The Cool History of Ice Cream

Ice cream has delighted people for centuries, with its earliest origins traced back to ancient China around 200 BC, where a frozen mixture of milk and rice was enjoyed by the elite. The Roman Emperor Nero is said to have sent runners into the mountains to bring back snow, which was then flavored with honey and fruit.

In the 13th century, Marco Polo returned to Europe from his travels in Asia with tales of a chilled dessert resembling what we now call sorbet. These ideas inspired early versions of ice cream across Italy and France.

By the 17th century, frozen desserts were being served to European royalty. In 1686, the first ice cream café opened in Paris, serving a variety of flavors to the public. Ice cream made its way to America in the 1700s and quickly became a favorite treat. Even George Washington reportedly spent hundreds of dollars on ice cream in a single summer.

The invention of the hand-cranked ice cream machine in the 19th century made it more accessible, and the rise of refrigeration turned ice cream into the global phenomenon it is today.

From sundaes to cones, and sorbets to soft serve — ice cream continues to be the go-to treat for sweet, cold happiness.
