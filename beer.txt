The History of Beer

Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic beverages in the world. Its origins can be traced back over 7,000 years to ancient Mesopotamia, where the Sumerians were already brewing a form of beer using barley. They even had a goddess of beer named Ninkasi!

In ancient Egypt, beer was a staple of the daily diet and was often safer to drink than water. It played a major role in religious rituals and was even used as currency to pay workers who built the pyramids.

During the Middle Ages, European monks became expert brewers and began refining the brewing process by adding hops for flavor and preservation. This led to the development of many modern beer styles we enjoy today.

Today, beer has evolved into a global industry with thousands of unique styles, from rich stouts and hoppy IPAs to light lagers and sour ales. Cheers to one of history's most enduring creations!
