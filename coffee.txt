The Story of Coffee

Coffee has a rich and energizing history that dates back to the 9th century. According to legend, an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi noticed that his goats became unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. These berries were later identified as coffee beans.

By the 15th century, coffee was being cultivated and traded in the Arab world, particularly in Yemen, where Sufi monks used it to stay awake during long religious ceremonies. Coffee houses, known as qahveh khaneh, quickly became popular centers for conversation, music, and political debate.

Coffee spread to Europe in the 17th century and was initially met with suspicion, even being called the "bitter invention of Satan." But after being approved by Pope Clement VIII, it took off. Coffee houses popped up in major cities like London, Paris, and Vienna, becoming hubs for artists, intellectuals, and revolutionaries.

Today, coffee is a global industry and daily ritual for billions of people. Whether itâ€™s a morning espresso or a cozy cup of brewed beans, coffee fuels conversation, creativity, and culture.
