The Delicious Origins of Pizza

Pizza, in its earliest form, dates back to ancient civilizations like the Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans, who all made flatbreads topped with oils, herbs, and cheese. But the modern pizza we know today began in Naples, Italy, during the 18th century.

Originally a street food for the poor, Neapolitan pizza was made with simple ingredients: dough, tomatoes, cheese, and sometimes basil. The most famous early version, the **Margherita**, was reportedly created in 1889 to honor Queen Margherita of Savoy, using the red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil) colors of the Italian flag.

Pizza made its way to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with Italian immigrants, especially in cities like New York and Chicago. It gained massive popularity after World War II, when returning soldiers brought their craving for pizza home with them.

Today, pizza is one of the most beloved foods worldwide. From thin crust to deep dish, from pineapple toppings to truffle oil, there's a slice for everyone. Whether it's gourmet or straight from the freezer, pizza continues to bring people together â€” one bite at a time.
